# Describe building automation with Microsoft Power Automate

Power Automate allows anyone with knowledge of the business process to create repeatable flows that, when triggered, perform the process for them.

## The Capabilities of Power Automate

Microsoft Power Automate is about having computers manage repetitive tasks. Common scenarios:

- Automating repetitive tasks such as moving data from one system to another.
- Guiding a user through a process so they can complete the different stages.
- Automating desktop based and website processes with Robotic Process Automation (RPA) capabilities.

### Type of Flows

1. **Business process flows**
- Used in model-driven apps to help people get work done
- They typically represent a process that a user follows through to completion
2. **Cloud flows**
- Cloud flows begin with a trigger such as receiving an email from a specific person, or a mention of your company in social media
- There are three types of cloud flows that you can make
    - Automated flows: automatically triggered by an event.
    - Instant flows: started automatically and are done with the click of a button.
    - Scheduled flows: run on a defined schedule. 
3. **Desktop flows**
- These robotic process automation (RPA) flows allow you to record yourself performing actions on your desktop or within a web browser.
- It's like a macro as it's playing back previously recorded steps in order.

# Different Power Automate Apps

There are three different Power Automate applications that makers can use to create and manage the different types of flows available.

- Power Automate Portal: can easily create, manage, and monitor the different Power Automate flows they created.
- Power Automate Mobile: Power Automate Mobile provides access to Power Automate functionality while on the go.
- Power Automate for Desktop: used to create robotic process automation flows.

# Describe the Components of a Cloud Flow

As you begin to create Power Automate flows, it's important to note that every cloud flow has two main parts.

## Triggers — Determine what starts the flow

While a flow only has one trigger, there are a few different types of triggers that can be used:

- When something changes: This type of trigger runs when data is changed. 
- On a schedule: You can set up a flow to be triggered at a certain time of day and with a recurrence.
- On a button press: This trigger takes shape in many ways. It can be when a flow virtual button is run via the mobile app and a physical button is clicked with third party options.

## Actions — Determine what the flow does

Actions are what you want to happen when a trigger is invoked. For example, the new email trigger starts the action of creating a new file on OneDrive. A typical Power Automate flow has multiple actions.

# Consider Power Automate Scenarios

1. Power Automate and Microsoft SharePoint
There are multiple ways that Power Automate could be used to support approval processes in SharePoint. For example, documents that contain sensitive information such as personal details, financial details, or strategies often require approval. 

2. Using Power Automate with Microsoft Outlook
Outlook provides many different opportunities where Power Automate could potentially be used to automate Outlook scenarios. For example, organizations often create SharePoint team sites that connect team members with shared content and resources. When users create pages on a site, organizations can start an approval process to ensure the content aligns with organizational standards. SharePoint can be easily configured to require that changes to a site be approved before they go live.

3. Using flows with Microsoft Forms
Schools frequently use Microsoft Forms for student quizzes. A teacher could use a flow that notifies them when a student turns in a quiz. A real-estate organization might use Microsoft Forms for new clients to provide details about themselves and the types of properties they're interested in. With a Power Automate flow, after a potential client completes the form, an email notification could be sent to an agent in their area.

4. Using flows with Microsoft Teams
Power Automate flows can be used in three scenarios with Teams:
- Trigger flows from Teams messages: You can create flows that are triggered when someone selects a Teams message. 
- Use flows with adaptive cards: Adaptive cards can be used as the trigger for flows.
- Create flows from within the Power Apps app in Teams: Use the Power Apps app in Teams to create flows that use Dataverse for Teams.

# Process Mining

Process mining helps organisations gain a better understanding of their real processes, how they're operated, and identify opportunities for improvement, automation, and digitisation.

- **Improve operational efficiency**: 
    - helps identify bottlenecks and inefficiencies in processes
    - allows organisations to streamline their operations and improve productivity
- **Enhance customer experience**
    - identifying process pain points and eliminating them
    - organisations can improve the customer experience and increase satisfaction.
- **Optimize resources**: 
    - enables businesses to identify opportunities for automation
    - reducing the need for manual intervention and allowing resources to be allocated more effectively.
- **Ensure compliance**: 
    - help organisations to identify noncompliant processes and take corrective action to avoid legal and financial risks.
- **Improve supply chain management processes**: 
    - create processes that help warehouse and operations managers gain insights into the material flow in the warehouse. 
    - help improve the performance of the warehouse.
