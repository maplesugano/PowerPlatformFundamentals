# Copilot Studio

Some highlights of Copilot Studio include:
- **Get started in seconds**: There's no infrastructure to maintain or complex systems to deploy.
- **Empower your subject matter experts**: Your Subject Matter Experts (SME) can create agents quickly and easily using a novel, intuitive, code-free graphical interface eliminating the need for AI expertise or teams of developers.
- **Enable rich, natural conversation**: Build the conversation using the graphical editor, and your agent is ready to manage customer requests.
- **Enable agents to act**: You can easily integrate with services and back-end systems out-of-the-box, or through hundreds of easy-to-add custom connectors using Power Automate.
- **Extend existing agents:**: Copilot Studio allows you to add more functionality to existing agents such as including your organisational data
- **Monitor and improve agent performance**: Copilot Studio lets you keep an eye on how your agents are performing using powerful metrics and AI-driven dashboards. 

# Components of Copilot Studio

1. Topics
In Copilot Studio, a topic defines how an agent conversation plays out. You can author topics by customizing provided templates, create new topics from scratch, or get suggestions from existing help sites.

2. Entities
One fundamental aspect of natural language understanding is to identify entities in a user dialog. An entity is an information unit that represents a real-world subject. Examples include a phone number, zip code, city, or person's name.

3. Actions
You can be calling a Microsoft Power Automate flow as actions, can be called within a topic.

4. Generative AI
Generative AI can be used if your agent is unable to identify a satisfactory answer. It can also be added to individual topics to provide a more targeted conversational experience by pulling data from different sources.

5. Publishing
With Copilot Studio, you can publish an agent to engage with your customers on multiple platforms or channels. 

# AI Builder
AI Builder is a Microsoft Power Platform capability that provides AI models that are designed to optimize your business processes. With AI hub, you can access two three regions: prompt, AI model, document automation.

There are two types of AI builder models, the pre-built one and the custom one.

# Pre-built AI Builder Models

| Prebuilt model | Purpose / What it does |
|----------------|------------------------|
| Business card reader | Detects business cards in images and extracts details such as name, job title, address, email, company, and phone numbers. |
| Category classification | Classifies text into ready-made business-specific categories; first model is optimized for customer-feedback scenarios (more models planned). |
| Entity extraction | Identifies key elements in text and classifies them into predefined categories, turning unstructured data into machine-readable structured data. |
| ID reader | Extracts information (e.g., first name, date of birth, gender) from passports, US driver licenses, Social Security cards, and green cards. |
| Invoice processing | Pulls out essential invoice fields such as invoice ID, invoice date, and amount due to automate invoice workflows. |
| Key phrase extraction | Finds the main talking points or key phrases in text (e.g., "food" and "great service" from a restaurant review). |
| Language detection | Detects the predominant language of a text and returns the language code along with a confidence score (0 â€“ 1). |
| Receipt processing | Uses OCR to detect printed and handwritten text on receipts and extracts key receipt information. |
| Sentiment analysis | Determines sentiment (positive, negative, neutral, or mixed) at both sentence and document levels, with corresponding scores. |
| Text recognition | Performs OCR on documents and images to convert printed or handwritten text into machine-readable character streams. |
| Text translation | Translates text in real time across 60+ languages and can auto-detect the source language, helping to remove language barriers. |
